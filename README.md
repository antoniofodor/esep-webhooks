# Event-Driven Architecture Assignment

This repository contains the implementation for an event-driven architecture assignment. The goal of this assignment was to develop an understanding of event-driven architectures, asynchronous communication between applications, and best practices in defensive programming.

## Overview
Event-driven architectures facilitate communication between applications asynchronously, introducing complexities beyond traditional synchronous models. The goal of this was to develop skills in event-driven programming, best practices, and defensive programming techniques.

## Functionality
The implemented solution consists of the following functionalities:
- Building a Lambda function that receives webhooks from GitHub.
- Triggering specific actions in response to GitHub events.
- Integration with Slack to post messages upon triggering events.
- Deployment of the Lambda function to AWS for execution.
- Configuration of environment variables to manage sensitive information.
- Implementation of error handling and defensive programming techniques.
